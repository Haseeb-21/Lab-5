     <p>
        <strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Haseeb Murtaza and this is my first year at BCIT. <br>
        I graduated from high school last year and took a gap year to improve some of my grades <br>
        and go abroad. Some of my hobbies are painting, riding my bike, and playing video games. <br>
        I also <em>love</em> to play and watch basketball. <br>
