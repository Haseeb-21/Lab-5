    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p1>
        <strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Haseeb Murtaza and this is my first year at BCIT. I graduated from <br>
        high school last year and took a gap year to improve some of my grades and go abroad. Some of my hobbies <br>
        are painting, riding my bike, and playing video games. I also <em>love</em> to play and watch basketball. <br>
